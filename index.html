      <h1>Ryan Arnaudin</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I am a UX designer in beautiful San Francisco.</p>
      <p>At my core I am a problem solver. I am a UX designer with over seven years of professional experience in the software industry, and before that I studied aerospace engineering. This path has provided me with a diverse toolset of design methodologies and analytical problem solving approaches that allow me to take on any type of challenge. As a result, I am not afraid of big multi-disciplinary problems. </p>
      <p>My passion lies in harnessing complex, emerging technologies in simple ways that empower people personally and professionally. I am a technologist with a humanist approach, designing systems and experiences where technology serves its users in productive, meaningful ways.</p>
      <p>I currently work at <a href="http://autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk</a> where I have been the UX lead for <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/cfd/overview" target="_blank">CFD simulation</a> since 2011. We make fluid flow and heat transfer simulation easy for analysts, engineers, and designers so they can make better products and spaces. My work can be seen in CFdesign 2011, Simulation CFD 2012/2013/2014/2015/2016, Flow Design, and on the Simulation 360 & Autodesk 360 cloud platforms.</p>
